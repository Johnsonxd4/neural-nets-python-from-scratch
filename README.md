# neural-nets-python-from-scratch
based on [neural networks from scratch in python](https://nnfs.io/), but not limited to it.
Heres some resources used to dig in how neural netoworks actually works under the hood.
Learning path: 
* [neural networks from scratch in python](https://nnfs.io/)
 - [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html)

* [reference case study](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/)

# Concepts table:
- [x] Neuron
        should be enough nnfs book. Pretty straightforward.
- [x] Categorical cross entropy
- [ ] Stochastic gradient descent
- [ ] Loos 
- [x] accuracy
- [x] Derivative
- [x] Partial Derivative
- [x] Gradient descendent
