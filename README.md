# neural-nets-python-from-scratch
based on [neural networks from scratch in python](https://nnfs.io/), but not limited to it.
Heres some resources used to dig in how neural netoworks actually works under the hood.
Learning path: 
* [neural networks from scratch in python](https://nnfs.io/)
 - [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html)

* [reference case study](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/)
* [Manual gradient descendent calculation](https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-gradient-descent-manually-6d9bee09aa0b)
